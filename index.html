    <h1>So here are the styling methods ....
        <br>
        <br>
        So the tag used for aligning texts in the middle is text-align: center;
        <br>
        <br>
        And the tag used for changing the color of text is font-color: aqua;
        <br>
        <br>
        The tag used to change the font style (means how its designed is) font-family: (whatever font I have told you how to take it from google fonts);
    <br>
    <br>
    And If you want to and some background to your page then the tag is background-image: url(wahtever url u want to paste); and just in case it makes up so many copies but you only gave one... give the tag background-size: 100px or blah whatever you want...
    <br>
    <br>
    All the rest will be thought next class.
